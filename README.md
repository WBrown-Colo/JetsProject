## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson I have learned is that using recommended fixes on Eclipse is not always a good idea. I still struggle with understanding the majority of the concepts I have been taught. By using recommended fixes, changes are made that I am not familiar with. My decisions have become detrimental to my application. I had everything working at one point, but created bugs by trying to streamline the application. I am not sure what wrong, and that is what I need to learn most.
